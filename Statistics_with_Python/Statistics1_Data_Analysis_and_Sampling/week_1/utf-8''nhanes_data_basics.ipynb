    "This notebook demonstrates using the [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) data processing library to read a dataset into Python, and obtain a basic understanding of its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Python by itself is a general-purpose programming language and does not provide high-level data processing capabilities.  The Pandas library was developed to meet this need.  Pandas is the most popular Python library for data manipulation, and we will use it extensively in this course.\n",

    "In addition to Pandas, we will also make use of the following Python libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) is a library for working with arrays of data\n",

    "* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) is a library for making graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) is a higher-level interface to Matplotlib that can be used to simplify many graphing tasks\n",

    "* [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) is a library that implements many statistical techniques\n",

    "### Importing libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "When using Python, you must always begin your scripts by importing the libraries that you will be using. After importing a library, its functions can then be called from your code by prepending the library name to the function name.  For example, to use the '`dot`' function from the '`numpy`' library, you would enter '`numpy.dot`'.  To avoid repeatedly having to type the libary name in your scripts, it is conventional to define a two or three letter abbreviation for each library, e.g. '`numpy`' is usually abbreviated as '`np`'.  This allows us to use '`np.dot`' instead of '`numpy.dot`'.  Similarly, the Pandas library is typically abbreviated as '`pd`'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following statement imports the Pandas library, and gives it the abbreviated name 'pd'."

    "\n",
    "We will be working with the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data from the 2015-2016 wave, which has been discussed earlier in this course.  The raw data for this study are available here:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Default.aspx\n",
    "\n",
    "As in many large studies, the NHANES data are spread across multiple files.  The NHANES files are stored in [SAS transport](https://v8doc.sas.com/sashtml/files/z0987199.htm) (Xport) format.  This is a somewhat obscure format, and while Pandas is perfectly capable of reading the NHANES data directly from the xport files, accomplishing this task is a more advanced topic than we want to get into here.  Therefore, for this course we have prepared some merged datasets in text/csv format."

    "Pandas is a large and powerful library.  Here we will only use a few of its basic features.  The main data structure that Pandas works with is called a \"data frame\".  This is a two-dimensional table of data in which the rows typically represent cases (e.g. NHANES subjects), and the columns represent variables.  Pandas also has a one-dimensional data structure called a `Series` that we will encounter occasionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has a variety of functions named with the pattern '`read_xxx`' for reading data in different formats into Python.  Right now we will focus on reading '`csv`' files, so we are using the '`read_csv`' function, which can read csv (and \"tsv\") format files that are exported from spreadsheet software like Excel.  The '`read_csv`' function by default expects the first row of the data file to contain column names.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using '`read_csv`' in its default mode is fairly straightforward.  There are many options to '`read_csv`' that are useful for handling less-common situations.  For example, you would use the option `sep='\\t'` instead of the default `sep=','` if the fields of your data file are delimited by tabs instead of commas.  See [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) for the full documentation for '`read_csv`'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas can read a data file over the internet when provided with a URL, which is what we will do below.  In the Python script we will name the data set '`da`', i.e. this is the name of the Python variable that will hold the data frame after we have loaded it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The variable '`url`' holds a string (text) value, which is the internet URL where the data are located.  If you have the data file in your local filesystem, you can also use '`read_csv`' to read the data from this file.  In this case you would pass a file path instead of a URL, e.g. `pd.read_csv(\"my_file.csv\")` would read a file named `my_file.csv` that is located in your current working directory."
